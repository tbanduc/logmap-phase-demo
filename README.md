# logmap-phase-demo
This is a repository containing code and examples for a log-map-based solver of the complex eikonal equation to initiate reentry on monodomain simulations. The corresponding paper for this method has been submitted for the 13th Functional Imaging and Modeling of the Heart International Conference (FIMH 2025).
